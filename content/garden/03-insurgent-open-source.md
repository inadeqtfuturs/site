What does it mean for open source projects to be sustainable? In what ways can we think about sustainability uncoupled from the capitalist logics of reproduction? What recourse do we have to alternative logics and ecologies for open source projects?

### technical

Coming off listening to a podcast about a new metaframework has me reeling a bit as the authors discuss the different monetization strategies that ultimately undermine the very idea of something being open source. Here, I want to take issue less with their contention that they're 'doing the work' and should be compensated as such, than at the problems with the intersection of an entrepreneurial ethos and so-called open source technology. There's a lot to unpack here, including the idea that open source depends on and co-constitues a kind of 'community,' that large corporations often utilize open source software without contributing to its development, participating in the community, or compensating its developers, and that these communities often laud those who move into positions of power or extract monetary gain from these projects. Briefly, this valorization of what we might call 'the great developer' or the '10x engineer' is a noxious stand in utilized to obscure the ways in which all development, all software, and all thought is ultimately iterative and sedimentary (and I say this to include teams with and without figureheads).

What I am not saying is that being an engineer somehow excises us from the logics of the everyday under neoliberalism. What I am saying is that open source as a concept and ethos should point through or away from those logics, undermining the fundamental concepts of neoliberal capital and the undercurrent of individual humanism.


### theoretical

What is the work that developers and software engineers do? How is it (and can it) be uncoupled from the logics of silicon valley and venture capitalism?
